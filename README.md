# Android Malware Analysis
Leveraging Machine Learning for Improved Android Malware Detection Android's popularity and open-source nature attract malware developers. Despite existing security mechanisms, Android remains 
vulnerable. Data science offers promising avenues for enhancing detection capabilities through analytical models. This paper explores static and dynamic analysis techniques for extracting features 
relevant to malware detection. It further highlights the potential of data science for predicting malicious activities and reviews the current state of the art in Android malware detection 
frameworks and research. We emphasize the need for combined static and dynamic analysis to capture a broader spectrum of features and propose further research on utilizing virtual cloud 
devices for effective malware detection. 
# Static analysis: 
it includes the methods that allow us to get information about the software that we want to analyze without executing it, one example of them is the study of the code, their callings, 
resources, etc. 
# Dynamic analysis: 
it is another approach where the idea is to analyze the cyber threat during its execution, in other words, get information about its behavior, some of their features are the net 
flows.
# Models: - 
**Navie Bytes:** â€“ Naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature. 
It's widely used in text classification, spam filtering, and various other applications including Android malware analysis. <br>
<br>
**Kneighbors:** -The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a straightforward, non-parametric, and instance-based learning method used for classification and regression tasks. It works by finding a 
predefined number (k) of training samples closest in distance to a new input and assigning a label based on the majority vote of its neighbors. <br>
<br>
**Random Forest:** - Random Forest is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by constructing multiple decision trees during the training phase and 
outputs the class that is the mode of the classes or mean prediction of the individual trees. <br>
<br>
Decision Trees: - A decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. In the context of Android malware analysis, decision trees can be 
used to classify whether an Android app is malicious or benign based on various features or attributes extracted from the app. <br>
<br>
**CNN:** - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of deep learning algorithm commonly used in image recognition and classification tasks. Its architecture is designed to process structured grid-like 
data such as images by learning local patterns through convolutional layers, pooling, and fully 
connected layers.
